The plot of monthly U.S. production of crude oil vs years recorded from Jan 1980 to Dec 2009 shows, 
i. a gradually increasing trend upto 1985 and a decreasing trend thereafter 
ii. the variance is uniform 
iii. there is a seasonality component during each year 
iv. there are no outliers
 v. there are abrupt changes in behaviour at few occassions.

From the summaries of residuals, it can be seen that, 
i. The residuals apart from few outliers or abnormal conditions resulting from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the lack in demand due to the credit crunch in 2008, seems to have zero mean and uniform variance from the plot of the residuals vs Time. 
ii. The residuals apart from the few outliers as same as above, look to satisy the condition of normality from the QQ plot. 
iii. The sample ACF and PACF shows that the outliers follow sinusoidal pattern.
